SPA Simple Calendar

Hello,wellcome to my new Simple SPA Calculator,
its pure JS code specified as module type of script.
as architecture,i used separate files to create separate functions, so it can be tracked, reused and easier to debug.
I imported each function into a file that needs its purpose, using a master file app.js wich is direct linked with the html file.
For 'redirecting' i made function hideAll to clear the innerHTML before show a clicked new view, to go back the previous Users can click 
on headers for better UX.
I am open for comments and feedbacks...
Thank you! :)
